This project’s dataset includes detailed information on schools within Texas split up by the state, region, district, and campus level. Datasets within include demographics and performance metrics for approximately 1,200 Texas school districts from 2017 to 2024. The data is compiled from publicly available information provided by the TEA website. For the purpose of this analysis, datafiles within the district level are going to be utilized.  See below for further descriptions of district level data. 

## District Data Overview 
District level data contains these features. 
* **District ID:** Unique identification code for each of the 1,207 school districts in the state of Texas.
* **District Type:** Categorization of a district based on student enrollment, overall population, and its urban-rural classification.
* **District Rating:** Detailed accountability reports for each district reflecting achievement and progress.
* **Teacher to Student Ratio:** The total number of students per district divided by the count of teachers in that district.

#### DEMOGRAPHIC DATA 
The demographic data inform the characteristics of the student population with school districts: 
• Student Racial and Ethnic Composition: Count of students in each district classified by racial and ethnic groups: African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, White, Pacific Islander, and two or more races. 
• Percent of Students Economically Disadvantaged: Count of students out of the total categorized as economically disadvantaged.

Bridging the Data Gap 
• Percent of Students Needing Special Education Services: Count of students out of the total who warrant special education services. 
• Percent of Students who are Bilingual or ESL: Count of students out of the total catego rized as bilingual or in English as a Second Language programs. 
• Percent of Students who are Immigrants: Count of students out of the total who are immigrants. 
2.3 PERFORMANCE DATA 
The performance data covers student outcomes: 
• STAAR Assessment Performance: The State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readi ness (STAAR) is a standardized test given in Texas public schools that measures what students know in core subjects. STAAR tests cover reading, writing, mathematics, science and social studies in grades 3-8. Results are reported as percentages that break down the student population into three exclusive performance measures: 
1. Approaches Grade Level: Indicates that students would need specific, targeted aca demic intervention to succeed in the course throughout future grade levels. 2. Meets Grade Level: Indicates that students are likely to succeed in the course in the future, although they may still need some short-term academic intervention. 3. Masters Grade Level: Indicates that students are expected to succeed in the course in future grades with little to no academic intervention. School districts tend to care more about their percent of students who perform at ’Meets Grade Level’ or higher, rather than the amount at ’Masters Grade Level’. 
• Graduation Rates: Percent of students graduating, broken down into demographic cate gories. 
• Dropout Rates: Percent of students dropping out of school, broken down into demographic categories and grade in which they dropped out. 
• Attendance: Student attendance rates, broken down into demographic categories and grade level.
