# Data Modeling README

## 4.1 Nearest Neighbor Model 
* Contains the most up to date logic to determine nearest neighbors
* Contains 7 different .py files to do logic. Primarry neighbors notebook is KNN_Model and primary function is find_nearest_districts. You can see the implementation of this model in the 1. Nearest Neighbors Implementation document

## 4.2 Nearest Neighbor Model Validation 
* Are three folders within this folder, 1. Nearest NEighbors Model, 2. Qualitative Model Validation, 3. Quantitative Model Validation
* There is 1. Nearest Neighbor MOdel ebcause at this step the nearest neighbors model was not final. The previous iteration of what is seen in 4.1
* 2 Contains the qunatiative work we did finding hte distance metrics. It entails the code we used to generate plots to send out to reports in local school districts for them to tell which distance metric yielded the best results
* 3. Contains the quantiative work finding the distance metrics. Involved in fitting neighbors model on various input parameters and calculating the average standardized variance of columns.
