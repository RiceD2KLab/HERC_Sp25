## Overview

#### Project Overview
Texas school districts face increasing pressure to meet accountability standards, yet many lack the resources to effectively analyze performance data. While public datasets exist, they are often fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to navigate.

Our project, supported by the Houston Education Research Consortium (HERC), simplifies this process by enabling districts to identify peer districts—those with similar demographics—for performance comparison and strategic collaboration. By providing a streamlined, data-driven approach, we help districts extract meaningful insights to drive informed decision-making and improve academic outcomes.

#### Objectives

In this semester, our team plans to build on the work done in Fall 2024, expanding on some of their strengths while addressing the areas they were unable to accomplish. Specifically, our objectives include:

* **Develop a User-Friendly Data Extraction Tool:** Create a web scraping tool that enables users to retrieve datasets from the TEA website, with the ability to update annually as new information is added, solving the problem of data becoming outdated. Unlike traditional methods that rely on data compression techniques like PCA, this tool will allow users to access complete, raw datasets while enhancing their usability through automated cleaning and standardization.

* **Facilitate Comparative Analysis Among School Districts:** Assist school districts in identifying and comparing themselves with similar districts by allowing users to select and prioritize relevant demographic features, thereby enhancing data-driven decision-making. The matching process should focus on demographic factors for similarities, rather than test scores and graduation rates, to allow districts to use those outcomes as a comparison after the fact.

* **Engage and Collaborate with Local School Districts:** Actively consult with Houston area school districts to gather insights and feedback, ensuring the tool aligns with their specific needs and preferences, and provide comprehensive documentation to support its effective use. 

* **Develop an Interactive Dashboard for District Comparisons:** Create a web-based or GUI-driven dashboard that allows users to visualize, compare, and analyze school district data interactively, making insights more accessible and actionable. This dashboard should be simpler and more applicable for districts than the one made in the prior semester.
