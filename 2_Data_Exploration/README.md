## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) README**  

In this section, we conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on district-level data to identify key patterns, trends, and relationships within the datasets. The analysis focuses on exploring individual datasets to uncover meaningful insights. The datasets explored are REF, GRAD, PERF1, PERF2, PROF, and STAAR1. 

### **Objectives of EDA**  
- Identify **important features** that may be useful for modeling.  
- Detect **data trends, distributions, and potential anomalies** across different years.  
- Generate **visualizations and summary statistics** to guide feature selection.  

Explore each notebook in this section to view **plots, statistical summaries, and key takeaways** from the data exploration process.
