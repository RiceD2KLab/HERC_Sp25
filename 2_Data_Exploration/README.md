## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) README**  

In this section, we conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on district-level data to identify key patterns, trends, and relationships within the datasets. The analysis focuses on exploring individual datasets to uncover meaningful insights. The datasets explored are:
  - **REF:** Geographical district informationREF, GRAD, PERF1, PERF2, PROF, and STAAR1. 
  - **PERF1:** College, career, and military readiness (CCMR), TSIA, College Prep
  - **PERF2:** AP/IB exam results, SAT/ACT results
  - **PROF:** Staff and student profiles, graduate profiles
  - **STAAR1:** STAAR Assessment results (Grades 3â€“8)
  - **GRAD:** Graduation, attendance, chronic absenteeism, dropout rates

### **Objectives of EDA**  
- Identify **important features** that may be useful for modeling.  
- Detect **data trends, distributions, and potential anomalies** across different years.  
- Generate **visualizations and summary statistics** to guide feature selection.  

Explore each notebook in this section to view **plots, statistical summaries, and key takeaways** from the data exploration process.
