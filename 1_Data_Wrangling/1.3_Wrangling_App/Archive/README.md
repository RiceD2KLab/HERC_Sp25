# Welcome to the TAPR Scraper App! üçµ  

## Overview
The TAPR Scraper App allows users to efficiently download multiple files from the TAPR Advanced Download Website:
[Texas Academic Performance Reports (TAPR)
](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2023/download/DownloadData.html  )

This tool simplifies the process of retrieving datasets by enabling users to specify download parameters and execute a batch download.

## Features
* Download multiple raw TAPR datasets based on selected years and variables to a raw_data folder
* Choose the data level (e.g., campus, district, region, or state)
* Save files directly to a specified directory
* Automatically cleans all raw_data files into a new clean_data folder. (Properly formats NA values, maps column IDs with real column names, joins district/region IDs with true names)
